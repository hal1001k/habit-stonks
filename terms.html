  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: October 2025</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of <strong>Habit Stonks</strong> (“the App”). 
    By using the App, you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>
    Habit Stonks provides tools for personal habit tracking. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.
    You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and not to exploit vulnerabilities or interfere with others’ data.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Ownership</h2>
  <p>
    You own all data you create within the App. Your habits, schedules, and logs remain your property. 
    By syncing to Supabase, you grant the App permission to store and retrieve your data solely for synchronization.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee that it will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with all devices.
    You assume full responsibility for using the App.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>

    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any damages resulting from the use of the App, including loss of data or productivity.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App integrates with Supabase (data hosting) and Google (authentication). 
    Your use of those services is also subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend access if you violate these Terms or misuse authentication systems.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Modifications</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use after revisions constitutes acceptance.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
