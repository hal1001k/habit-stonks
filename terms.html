<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Effective date: <strong>November 01, 2025</strong></p>

<h2>1) Agreement</h2>
<p>By using Habit Stonks (“the App”), you accept these Terms. If you do not agree, discontinue use immediately.</p>

<h2>2) Service description</h2>
<p>The App helps you track personal habits. Data may be stored locally and, if you enable synchronization, on our self-hosted cloud backend.</p>

<h2>3) Accounts and authentication</h2>
<p>You may sign in using Google Sign-In or another supported method. You are responsible for maintaining control of your account and device. We may suspend or delete accounts that violate these Terms or threaten service integrity.</p>

<h2>4) Your data</h2>
<p>You retain ownership of all content you create. You grant us a limited license to process and store it solely to provide synchronization and related functionality.</p>

<h2>5) Acceptable use</h2>
<p>You agree not to misuse the App, attempt unauthorized access, interfere with other users, or use it for unlawful purposes.</p>

<h2>6) Third-party services</h2>
<p>We rely on cloud infrastructure and authentication providers (e.g., Google). Their own terms and privacy policies also apply.</p>

<h2>7) Intellectual property</h2>
<p>The App’s source code, design, and trademarks remain the property of Individual Entrepreneur Daud Gazizullin. These Terms do not grant you ownership of intellectual property rights.</p>

<h2>8) Warranty disclaimer</h2>
<p>The App is provided “as is” and “as available.” We do not warrant that it will be error-free, uninterrupted, or compatible with all devices.</p>

<h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect or consequential damages, data loss, or profit loss.</p>

<h2>10) Termination</h2>
<p>You may terminate your account at any time by deleting it within the App. 
    We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or threaten service integrity.</p>
