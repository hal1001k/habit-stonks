  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: October 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Habit Stonks</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “our”) collects, uses, and protects your personal data.
    We are committed to respecting your privacy and complying with applicable data protection laws.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Store</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> All habits, schedules, and logs are stored locally on your device using an encrypted local database.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Sync (Optional):</strong> If you choose to sign in and enable synchronization, data is securely stored in your Supabase account, which uses PostgreSQL and Supabase Auth hosted on your chosen Supabase region.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> When using Google Sign-In or other providers, we store only your unique user ID (UUID) and email. No OAuth tokens or passwords are stored in our app or servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is used solely to operate the app — for example, displaying your habits, tracking progress, or synchronizing between devices. We do not use your information for advertising, analytics, or profiling.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not share or sell your data to third parties.
    Supabase acts as a data processor providing backend hosting.
    Google acts as an identity provider when you sign in.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access and export your data at any time.</li>
    <li>Delete your account and data permanently by deleting your Supabase user or uninstalling the app.</li>
    <li>Contact us to request manual deletion if needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Security</h2>
  <p>All communications with the backend are encrypted via HTTPS/TLS. Local databases are accessible only within your device sandbox. We employ optimistic concurrency and UUID-based isolation to prevent cross-user access.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for users under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.</p>

  <h2>7. Policy Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy periodically. The “Effective Date” above reflects the latest revision. Continued use after updates means you accept the revised version.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
